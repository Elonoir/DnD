## Introduction

Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) is a difficult game with many different rules to grasp for new players. New players encounter various problems in understanding the many rules, theatre of the mind, and the overflow of information. Even though there is a starter set in which the game is introduced. This experience is still complicated and a lacklustre experience. Therefore my research question is: What can I design to facilitate the entry to the game ‘Dungeons and Dragons’ and to improve the first game experience?
